# Facial-Recognition-Attendance-System

## INTRODUCTION
This is a project about the Facial Recognition-Based Attendance System for Educational Institutions. In this chapter, the problem and motivation, research objectives, project scope, project contributions, and background information of the project will be discussed in detail.

## Problem Statement 
According to the previous attendance management systems. This is because the attendance might not be recorded personally by the original person, in other words, the attendance of a particular person can be taken by a third party without the realization of the institution which violates the accuracy of the data. For example, student A is lazy to attend a particular class, so student B helped him/her to sign for attendance in fact student A didn’t attend the class, but the system overlooked this matter due to no enforcement practiced. Supposing the institution establish an enforcement, it might need to waste a lot of human resource and time which in turn will not be practical at all. Thus, all the recorded attendance in the previous system is not reliable for analysis usage. The second problem with the previous system is that it is too time-consuming. Assuming the time taken for a student to sign his/her attendance on a 3-4 paged name list is approximately 1 minute. In 1 hour, only approximately 60 students can sign their attendance which is obviously inefficient and time-consuming. The third issue is with the accessibility of that information by the legitimate concerned party. For example, most parents are very concerned about tracking their child’s actual whereabouts to ensure their kid really attends the classes in college/school. However, in the previous system, there were no ways for the parents to access such information. Therefore, evolution is needed to be done to the previous system to improve efficiency, and data accuracy and provides accessibility to the information for those legitimate party.

### The following are the objectives of the project:
- To ensure the speed the attendance recording process is faster than the previous system which can go as fast  as approximately 3 seconds for each student.
- Have enough memory space to store the database.
- Able to recognize the face of an individual accurately based on the face database.
- Allow parents to track their child’s attendance.
- Develop a database for the attendance management system.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for admins to access the attendance database and for parents to check their child’s attendance by mailing the attendance.
- Allow new students or staff to store their faces in the database.

## Project Scope
The main intention of this project is to solve the issues encountered in the old attendance system while reproducing a brand new innovative smart system that can provide convenience to the institution. In this project, we will be developing a project that can recognize the identity of each individual and eventually record the data into a database system. Apart from that, an Excel sheet is created which shows the student's attendance.

### Impact, Significance, and Contributions
Many attendance management systems that exist nowadays lack efficiency and information sharing. Therefore, in this project, those limitations will be overcome and further improved and are as follows :
- Students will be more punctual in attending classes. This is due to the attendance of a student can only be taken personally and any absentees will be noticed by the system. This can not only train the student to be punctual as well as avoid any immoral ethics such as signing the attendance for their friends.
- The institution can save a lot of resources as enforcement are now done by means of technology rather than human supervision which will waste a lot of human resource for an insignificant process.
- It saves a lot of cost in the sense that it eliminates the paperwork completely.
- The system is also time-effective because all calculations are automated. In short, the project is developed to solve the existing issues in the old attendance system.

## CONCLUSION
Before the development of this project. There are many loopholes in the process of taking attendance using the old method which caused many troubles for most of the institutions. Therefore, the facial recognition feature embedded in the attendance monitoring system can not only ensure attendance is taken accurately and eliminate the flaws in the previous system. Using technology to conquer defects cannot merely save resources but also reduce human intervention in the whole process by handling all the complicated tasks of the machine. The only cost to this solution is to have sufficient space to store all the faces in the database storage. Fortunately, there is such an existence of micro-SD that can compensate for the volume of the data. In this project, the face database is successfully built. Apart from that, the face recognition system is also working well.
